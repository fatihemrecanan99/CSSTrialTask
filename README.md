Question 1
You'll need a basic development environment set up on your computer to run the provided code. Here's how you can get started:

Environment:

Operating System: Any OS like Windows, macOS, or Linux can be used for web development.
Web Browser: A modern web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge to view your webpage.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment):

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): It's a free, lightweight, and powerful code editor developed by Microsoft. You can install extensions for various languages and tools, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and much more.
Steps to Run the Code:

a. Setting Up:

Download and install Visual Studio Code from here.
Create a new folder/directory on your computer for your project; let's name it "css_mastery".
Create two files inside the "css_mastery" folder: index.html and styles.css.
b. Writing the Code:

Could you copy the provided HTML code and paste it into index.html?
Copy the provided CSS code and paste it into styles.css.
c. Viewing the Project:

Open Visual Studio Code.
Go to File > Open Folder and select the "css_mastery" folder.
With index.html open in VS Code, right-click anywhere in the file and select Open with Live Server. (Note: If you don't see this option, you might need to install the "Live Server" extension from the VS Code extensions marketplace.)
This will automatically launch your default web browser and display your webpage.
The "Live Server" extension provides a local development server. It automatically reloads the page whenever you save changes to your files, making it very convenient to see updates in real-time.


Question 2
Remember:

Replace 'path_to_custom_cursor.png' with the actual path to your custom cursor image.
It's important to test responsiveness for various screen sizes. You can use media queries to adapt your design to mobile screens.
Visual feedback for interactive elements has been implemented using hover effects, and you can extend this with active, focus, etc.
Keep the code clean, well-organized, and well-commented for better readability.
To run and test, follow the steps in the previous answer regarding setting up an environment with Visual Studio Code.
